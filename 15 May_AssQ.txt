name = "John Doe"
# List variable
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?

# Convert a string to an integer
num_str = "42"
num_int = int(num_str)
print(num_int)  # Output: 42

# Convert a float to an integer
num_float = 3.14
num_int = int(num_float)
print(num_int)  # Output: 3 (the decimal part is truncated)

Q6. What is a complex number in mathematics, and how is it represented in Python?
Ans:In mathematics, a complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form a + bj, 
where a and b are real numbers, and j is the imaginary unit, defined as the square root of -1. 
The real part a represents the real portion of the complex number, and the imaginary part b represents the imaginary portion of the complex number.
# Creating a complex number: 3 + 2j
a = complex(3, 2)
print(a)  # Output: (3+2j)
